## NIOSH
- HELD
Our division (Health Effects Laboratory Division [(HELD)](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/contact/im-held.html)) is located at Morgantown, West Virginia. As a federal research institute, we are happy to work with industrial developers and academic collaborators to develop efficient and comprehensive evaluation procedures and publish peer-reviewed communications (standards organizations value our results and reports).

- Test: We plan to do the first test (Load positioning, move the load among four positions, page 4) this summer. We will measure ground reaction force, subjectsâ€™ kinematics and physiological response with and without wearing upper-body/back exoskeletons (e.g., using EMG, NIRS, ECG, Vicon and force plate). It would be our first exoskeleton test to explore what  we need for the future evaluation and modeling.
