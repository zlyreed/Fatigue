		  - [29-1171 Nurse practitioners](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291171.htm): Diagnose and treat acute, episodic, or chronic illness, independently or as part of a healthcare team. May focus on health promotion and disease prevention. May order, perform, or interpret diagnostic tests such as lab work and x rays. May prescribe medication. Must be registered nurses who have specialized graduate education.
		  - [29-1141 Registered Nurses](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes291141.htm): Assess patient health problems and needs, develop and implement nursing care plans, and maintain medical records. Administer nursing care to ill, injured, convalescent, or disabled patients. May advise patients on health maintenance and disease prevention or provide case management. Licensing or registration required. Registered nurses, with 2.9 million jobs, was the **largest** healthcare occupation.
		  - Other than registered nurses, the largest healthcare occupations were nursing assistants (1.5 million), home health aides (820,960), and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (702,700). (See [table 1](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ocwage.pdf))
