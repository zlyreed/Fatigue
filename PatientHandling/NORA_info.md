  - [National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health](https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/mus/researchagenda.html):
    The National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health is intended to identify the knowledge and actions most urgently needed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This agenda provides a vehicle for stakeholders to describe the most relevant issues, research gaps, and needs for occupational musculosketetal health. It is meant to be broader than any one agency or organization.
Agenda development began in early 2017, when the Musculoskeletal Health Council held a series of monthly meetings to discuss research topics seen as gaps in the body of knowledge on workplace MSDs. Between meetings, individual members or ad hoc working groups comprised of Council members met to develop text for each of the topics. In May 2017, the Council Co-Chairs consolidated and edited the draft document to turn it into a more cohesive document rather than individual paragraphs or sections based on topic area created by the working groups. In May, June, and July Council members were given the opportunity to discuss the changes or edits made by the Co-Chairs and the initial draft of the National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health was completed in February 2018 and prepared for public comment at that time. Minor revisions were made in response to the comments, and the final version was published.
     - Objective 1: Define the incidence and impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)
	 - Objective 2: Understand the risk factors for work-related MSDs
	 - Objective 3: Describe the underlying mechanisms of MSDs
	 - Objective 4: Develop and evaluate interventions to prevent MSDs and limit disability due to MSDs
	 - Objective 5: Disseminate and implement interventions to prevent MSDs and limit disability
