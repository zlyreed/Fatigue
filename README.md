 Measure Fatigue:
 - Measurement of human muscle fatigue [VÃ¸llestad, 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9219890)
   - "Indirect methods as endurance times and electromyography show variable responses during exercise and no close relationship to fatigue. Hence these methods are of limited value in measurement of human muscle fatigue."
