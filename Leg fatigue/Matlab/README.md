## Process testing data:
- Record the subject/testing information into excel files.
  - There are normally three data folders (**Vivon_Matlab**, **OximeterData**, **Noraxon_mat**) under each testing (testing No. is different than the subject No. since the same subject might attend multiple tests). 

- Process the raw data into .mat files. 

   - From Vicon (including **Force**, __Events__, __VMG__, __possible EMG__)
     - For short trials (such as reference trials: resting and MVC)
	 
	 - For long trials 
	 	 
	 - For extremely long trials 

     
   - From Noraxon (The .mat files can be exported directly from Noraxon software)
     - EMG
     - Biomonitor
   
   - From Nonion (Oximeter)
     - Event
     - Oxygen reading
