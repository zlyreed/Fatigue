**ECG**

- Some basic [terms](https://www.physionet.org/tutorials/hrv/#hr-extraction)
  - [QRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex): The QRS complex is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). In other words, it's the main spike seen on an ECG line.

  - [Normal-to-Normal(NN) interval](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16076/what-is-the-difference-between-rr-intervals-and-nn-intervals-in-hrv-data) (filter RR intervals to produce NN intervals): all intervals between adjacent QRS complexes resulting sinus node depolarization.
     - The difference between RR interval and NN interval: NN intervals refer to the intervals between **normal** R-peaks. During a measurement, artifacts may arise due to arrhythmic events or faulty sensors, for example (Citi, Brown & Barbieri, 2012). This may lead to abnormal R-peaks, which may in turn distort the statistical measures. To ensure reliable and valid data, only normal R-peaks are selected. Alternatively, the abnormal R-peaks can be corrected. 
	 In practice, however, RR-intervals and NN-intervals are synonymous (Tarvainen, 2014; Wiki). The use of "NN-intervals" is merely used to emphasize that normal R-peaks were used.
