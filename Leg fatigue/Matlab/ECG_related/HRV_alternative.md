**Calcualte the regular HRV parameters in the beginning and ending windows of the isometric tasks**

1. load RR data

2. Remove the 'steps' (preprocess RR data)

3. Obtain the desired windows:
   - get the time value of the starting pulling and fatigue (RPE=19)
   - in the begining
   - at the ending
   
4. Functions of HRV 
   - HRV_time   
   - HRV_nonlinear   
   - HRV_frequency
   - HRV_fragmentation
   
 5. Comparison between two windows (begining vs. ending)
