   1. The [Neuromap](https://www.delsys.com/neuromap/) system – which uses our Galileo sensor to extract Neural Firings from Individual Motor Units during functional movements. This is a mini-grid system that has its own software (API also available/included) and the primary use is for motor unit data. It is available now.

   2. The maize system is a 16ch grid sensor that like all other avanti sensors (including galileo/Neuromap), will be compatible with the Trigno wireless receiver. Est release is closer to fall 2019. Estimated cost $6K
   3. The Tiber system is a 64ch grid system that will also be wireless, but will have its own dedicated receiver. Est release end of 2019, early 2020. I don’t have any pricing on this as yet.

   - Muscle fiber conduction velocity (CV): The three single differential signals with higher similarity and propagation were used t oestimate muscle fiber CV [(Rainoldi, 1999)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=repeatability+of+surface+EMG+variables+during+voluntary+isometric+contractions+of+the+biceps+brachii+muscle). CVs were estiamted using two adjacent double differential signals (based on one triplet of single differential signals).
   - The rate of decrease of muscle fiber CV was found steeper in the dynamic than isometric task in both muscles. A sequence of dynamic pull-ups lead to higher fatigue than sustaining the body weight in an isometric condition at half-way of pull-up.
