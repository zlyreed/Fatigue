   1. The [Neuromap](https://www.delsys.com/neuromap/) system – which uses our Galileo sensor to extract Neural Firings from Individual Motor Units during functional movements. This is a mini-grid system that has its own software (API also available/included) and the primary use is for motor unit data. It is available now.

   2. The maize system is a 16ch grid sensor that like all other avanti sensors (including galileo/Neuromap), will be compatible with the Trigno wireless receiver. Est release is closer to fall 2019. Estimated cost $6K
   3. The Tiber system is a 64ch grid system that will also be wireless, but will have its own dedicated receiver. Est release end of 2019, early 2020. I don’t have any pricing on this as yet.
