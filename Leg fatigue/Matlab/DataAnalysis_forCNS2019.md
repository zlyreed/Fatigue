**1. Based on the pre-processed testing data**
- Processed testing data ([see the processing steps](README.md)) were under the folder ".../MuscleFatigue_Testing" ( S13 to S22 (Test No.: 12 to 21)who had ECG data)
- Subject info was recorded in "LegFatigueTesting_RPE_recording.xlsx"
- Matlab code: ".../LegFatigue_matlab/measures_BeforeVsAfter.m"


**2. Measures between the begining (light) and end (tired, RPE>=18)**
- EMG
  - time domain
  - frequency domain

- ECG
  - time domain
  - frequency domain

- NIRS
  - brain
  - muscle
  
**3. Figures**
