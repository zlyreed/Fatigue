## Isometric Leg Contraction (sitting posture; 90-degree knee angle)
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Reference trials:  resting and the maximum exertion (MVC trials).
   - 60% or 30% of the maximum exertion trials (MVC30_Fatigue or MVC60_Fatigue): hold until fatigue (RPE values were asked every 20-60seconds)
   - The maximum exertion level was checked everty time after the fatiguing trials
   
   **Measurements:**
   - EMG: recorded on seven leg muscles
   
     - ![7EMG_legfatigue](figures/7EMG_legfatigue.png "7EMG_legfatigue")
   
   - VMG
   
   - NIRS
   
   - Kinematics
